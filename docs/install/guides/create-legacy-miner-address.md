# BitcoinIL Creating Mining Legacy Address

We'll need a `Legacy` address for our miner to be able to send us the block rewards, to do that we'll once again open the wallet console by going to `Window -> Console`, and input the command:

```
getnewaddress "miner" "legacy"
```

like so:

The console will output a new legacy address that you need to copy to a safe place as we'll need it in a moment to configure our miner.

In my case the wallet created the following address: `moVw1tzfSDudWSBJS75zoGoMVVjtRXrAQP`
